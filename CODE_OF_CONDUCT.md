# Code of Conduct

Purpose
-------
This document defines expected behavior for all participants in this project to ensure an inclusive, respectful, and productive community.

Scope
-----
Applies to all spaces related to the project: code repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, mailing lists, chat channels, and events.

Expected Behavior
-----------------
- Be respectful, civil, and constructive.
- Focus feedback on code and ideas, not individuals.
- Use inclusive language; avoid slurs, insults, or discriminatory remarks.
- Assume good faith, ask clarifying questions, and explain suggestions.
- Respect others’ time and commitments.

Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------
Examples include, but are not limited to:
- Harassment, threats, or abusive language.
- Discriminatory remarks based on protected characteristics (race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, etc.).
- Personal attacks, doxxing, or sharing private information.
- Trolling, deliberate disruption, or spamming.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern.

Reporting and Contact
---------------------
If you experience or witness a violation, report it to the project maintainers:
- Email: your-contact@example.com
- Alternatively open a private issue labeled "code-of-conduct" or contact a maintainer directly.

When reporting, include:
- A description of the incident (what happened, when, where).
- Names or handles of involved parties.
- Relevant links, screenshots, or logs.

Enforcement
-----------
Maintainers will handle reports promptly and confidentially:
1. Acknowledge receipt of the report.
2. Gather relevant information and, if needed, speak with involved parties.
3. Choose appropriate actions depending on severity: warning, temporary suspension, removal of contributions, or banning from project spaces.
4. Notify involved parties of the outcome. Confidentiality will be respected when possible.

Appeals
-------
If you disagree with an action, you may request a review by contacting the maintainers at the reporting address. Provide additional context or evidence for reconsideration.

Non-Retaliation
--------------
Retaliation against anyone who makes a good-faith report or participates in an investigation is prohibited and will itself be considered a violation.

Acknowledgements
----------------
This project values a healthy community. Maintaining a welcoming environment is a shared responsibility of contributors and maintainers.
